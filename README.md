## 1)	Uber dataset
During my course work at UCLA, I have used the travel time data provided by Uber and used that to visualized the travel time changes during the pandemic in Los Angeles. Here are some graphs I made on the homework project using Uberâ€™s data.

These two graphs illustrate the travel time and travel speed changes in LA area and they are plotted using Matplotlib in Python.

## 2)	Investment research
Prior to join tech industry, I was a data scientist researching about implicit market connection. Here are some samples:

The left graph is a regression done in Tableau and the right is a graph doing cumulative counting on time series.

The following graph is a backtesting result for one of our quant trading strategy, showing the same strategy performance with different parameters and their comparison with Bitcoin performance.

## 3) Machine Learning
For Deep learning course CS260C in UCLA, this is the result of grid search on the learning rate vs Momentum for training a 15-epoch training and testing process with 2 layer fully connected Neuron network on MNIST dataset:

## 4) Geographical data

### 4.1 Housing price dataset in California
This is housing price dataset is from [Kaggle: california-housing-prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices), and I did a simple machine learning to predict the housing price in the CS 148M Intro to Data Science course project.

### 4.2 AirBnB price dataset in NY
Booking data is from [Inside AirBnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). This graph show part of the pricing and location for each AirBnB host in NYC area, and it is also a course project for CS 148M
